    <p>When I was young there was an amazing publicatication called
    <em>The Whole Earth Catalog</em> which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named
    <a href="#">Stewart Brand</a>not far from here Menlo park, and he brought it to a life with his poetic touch.This was in <strong>late 1960s</strong>before computers and desktop publications so it was well made with typewriters,scissors and Polaroid cameras. <small>It was sort of like Google in paperback from 35 years before Google form came along:It was idealistic and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.</small>
